# Process_pbsim_data.py
Run Process_pbsim_data.py to evaluate mappings of data generated by PBSIM simulator.

Usage example:
 
    Process_pbsim_data.py process simulation_root_folder mappings.sam annotations.bed

## Output
[TODO:]

## Evaluating a complex simulated dataset
The script is written so that it can evaluate a file obtained from several simulations. Each simulation can use different coverage, but needs to use the same reference genome. Reads simulated within a single simulation need to have the same FASTA header prefix. All PBSIM output folders (for different simulations) must be within the simulation_root_folder, and a dictionary simFolderDict (inside Process_pbsim_data.py script) should be modified to connect each simualted read header with the corresponding pbsim output folder.

## Example
Lets assume that we use three simulations, Pbsim output folders are named group1, group2 and group3, and header prefixes for eache simulation's reads are SimG1, SimG2 and SimG3 respectively.
Then all three simulation folders must be placed directly within simulation_root_folder and the dictionary simFolderDict, within the Process_pbsim_data.py script, must be definied as:

    simFolderDict = {'SimG1' : 'group1'
                   , 'SimG2' : 'group2'
                   , 'SimG3' : 'group3'}
